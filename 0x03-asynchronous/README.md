Project Overview
This project explores asynchronous programming concepts in [your language here, e.g., Dart, JavaScript, Python]. It demonstrates how to write non-blocking code that can handle tasks like network requests, timers, and file I/O without stopping the main program flow.

What is Asynchronous Programming?
Asynchronous programming allows multiple operations to run concurrently. Instead of waiting for a task to finish before moving on, the program continues executing and processes the result of the task once it’s completed.

Features
Use of async functions and await keyword

Handling Futures / Promises

Callback functions

Managing concurrency

Practical examples like API calls, timers, and file operations

What does asynchronous mean?
Asynchronous refers to processes or operations that happen independently of the main program flow, allowing other tasks to continue without waiting for them to finish immediately.

In more detail:
Synchronous operations block the program until they complete. The program “waits” and can’t do anything else during that time.

Asynchronous operations start and then let the program keep running other code while waiting for the operation to complete.

Example:
Imagine you order food at a restaurant.

Synchronous: You place your order and wait at the counter until your food is ready before you do anything else.

Asynchronous: You place your order, then sit down and do other things while the kitchen prepares your food. When it’s ready, they call your name.

In programming:
Asynchronous code allows your program to handle tasks like network requests, file reading, or timers without freezing or blocking the whole app.

Languages use things like callbacks, promises, futures, and async/await to work asynchronously.

Quick analogy:
Synchronous = Wait in line
Asynchronous = Take a buzzer and wait elsewhere
