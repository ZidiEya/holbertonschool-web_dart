🐦 What is Dart?
Dart is a modern, object-oriented, statically-typed programming language developed by Google. It is optimized for building fast, multi-platform applications, especially for:

✅ Client-side development (mobile, web, and desktop)

🚀 Flutter — Dart’s most popular framework — used to build beautiful, natively compiled apps for iOS, Android, Web, Windows, macOS, and Linux from a single codebase.

🔧 Key Features of Dart
Sound null safety: Eliminates null errors at compile time.

Fast compilation: Supports both ahead-of-time (AOT) and just-in-time (JIT) compilation.

Flexible syntax: Inspired by JavaScript, Java, and C# — easy to learn.

Rich standard library: Offers built-in support for collections, async programming, and more.

Optimized for UI: Especially powerful when used with Flutter for building responsive UIs.

🌍 Where is Dart Used?
🖼️ Flutter apps: The primary language for Flutter, which powers apps like Google Ads, Alibaba, eBay Motors, and more.

🕸️ Web development: Dart can compile to JavaScript via dart2js or run in the browser via DartPad.

🖥️ Command-line tools and server-side applications.
